# React Practice Application

This React application is a simple project created to practice core concepts in React, including state management, lifting state up, conditional rendering, and dynamic styles. The project is designed to help you strengthen your understanding of these fundamental concepts and improve your React development skills.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-practice-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```
   cd react-practice-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. You can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Overview

This React practice application focuses on the following core concepts:

### State Management

The application demonstrates how to create and manage state in React components. You'll find examples of using both `useState` and `useContext` for state management.

### Lifting State Up

To understand the concept of lifting state up, this application includes components that pass data and functions as props to child components, allowing for shared state and actions between components.

### Conditional Rendering

You'll explore conditional rendering techniques in React by rendering components or elements based on certain conditions. This helps you build dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

### Dynamic Styles

The application showcases how to apply dynamic styles to components based on state or other conditions. This is essential for creating visually appealing and interactive user interfaces.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/components`: Contains the various React components used in the application.
- `src/App.js`: The main application component where state is managed and components are rendered.
- `src/App.css`: Styling for the main application component.
- `src/context`: Contains context providers and consumers for state management.
- `public`: Contains static assets like images and the `index.html` file.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and modify the code to better understand the concepts. You can use this project as a starting point for your React development and build upon it by adding more features and complexity.
